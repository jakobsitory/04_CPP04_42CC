# **C++ Module 04**

This repository contains solutions to various C++ programming challenges from the 42 School curriculum. Each module is designed to deepen students' understanding of different programming concepts and techniques.

## **Modules**

### **ex00 - Polymorphism**
The Polymorphism project involves creating a class hierarchy to demonstrate the concept of polymorphism in C++.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a base class and derived classes.
- Demonstrating runtime polymorphism using virtual functions.
- Understanding the use of pointers and references to base class objects.

### **ex01 - I don’t want to set the world on fire**
The I don’t want to set the world on fire project involves creating a class that simulates a fire-related scenario using polymorphism.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a class hierarchy with fire-related classes.
- Demonstrating polymorphism through virtual functions.
- Managing resources and state within the class hierarchy.

### **ex02 - Abstract class**
The Abstract class project involves creating an abstract base class and derived classes to demonstrate the use of abstract classes in C++.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing an abstract base class with pure virtual functions.
- Creating derived classes that override the pure virtual functions.
- Demonstrating the use of abstract classes and polymorphism.

### **ex03 - Interface & recap**
The Interface & recap project involves creating interfaces and implementing them in derived classes, along with a recap of previous concepts.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing interfaces using abstract classes.
- Creating derived classes that implement the interfaces.
- Recapping and demonstrating the use of polymorphism, inheritance, and abstract classes.
